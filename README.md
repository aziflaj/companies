# CompaniesPortal

This is a small application developed using [Struts2](https://struts.apache.org/) and [JSP](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/jsp/index.html), as a "homework" while studying at IkubINFO Academy.

The project uses Maven as building tool.

## Set up

The project uses MySQL database to store the data. You can find both the SQL script and the schema in the `docs/` folder.

After migrating the DB, make sure to put your credentials in the `database.properties` file in the resources folder.
